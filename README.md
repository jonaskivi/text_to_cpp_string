text_to_cpp_string
==================

Convert text files or source code files to C++ strings that can be embedded in your code

usage example
./text_to_cpp_string ./your_text_file.txt

Currently outputs and OVERWRITES without warning a file named ./your_text_file.hpp.hpp
It is believed that you can add many files as input, but it has not been tested yet. :)
